# TicTacToe CLI

A tiny implementation of TicTacToe that uses the command line for input and
output. This project is done for a school lesson. The aim is to solve
the given problem by using the state machine pattern.


The end-state is pretty useless, but I left it in there, for the sake of
the task. It could theoretically be merged with the splash-state.

Don't take this as a good example, I don't know if I did it in a proper
manner. I can also ensure you, that this isn't idiomatic golang!

## How do I use it

Simply get the code:

```shell
go get github.com/Bios-Marcel/tictactoego
```
