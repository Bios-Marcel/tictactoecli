# TicTacToe CLI

A tiny implementation of TicTacToe that uses the command line for input and
output. THis project is done for a schoolclass lesson. The aim is to solve
the given problem by using the state machine pattern. Don't take this as a
good example, I don't know if I did it in a proper manner. I ensure you,
that this isn't idiomatic golang!

## How do I use it

Simply get the code:

```shell
go get github.com/Bios-Marcel/tictactoego
```
